Description: Several packages (the `rock`, `dct`, and
  `justifier` packages) leverage the YAML format to
  facilitate systematic encoding of information in a format
  that is both machine- and human-readable. The yum package
  provides a number of functions to facilitate this in a
  uniform manner with minimal dependencies (i.e. only suggests
  the yaml and data.tree packages to enable additional functionality).
