yum: YAML Utilities & More
==========================

The goal of `yum` is to provide a number of functions to work with files that contain one or more YAML fragments. Several packages leverage the YAML format to facilitate systematic encoding of information in a format that is both machine- and human-readable. The yum package provides a number of functions to facilitate this in a uniform manner with minimal dependencies (i.e. only suggests yaml and data.tree to enable additional functionality).
